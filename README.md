# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Scans

This project focuses on building a **Deep Learning model** to classify brain tumors from MRI images into four categories:

* **Glioma**
* **Meningioma**
* **Pituitary Tumor**
* **No Tumor**

The goal is to assist medical professionals in faster and more accurate tumor detection using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** implemented in **PyTorch**.

## 🚀 Features

* Preprocessing of MRI scans (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
* CNN-based deep learning model built using PyTorch.
* Training and validation pipelines with accuracy and loss graphs.
* **Model evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
* **Heatmaps (Grad-CAM)** for model interpretability.
* Graphical representation of predictions.
